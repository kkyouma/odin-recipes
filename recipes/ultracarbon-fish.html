        <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>Here, during the summer, it gets so hot that temperatures hover around the necessary limits for nuclear fusion, which we used to take advantage of for cooking our fish. This often turned the food into ashes, resulting in a somewhat bland meal; our ancestors used to call this version 'ffish'. But, thanks to a surprising technological breakthrough (we discovered fire), we now exclusively cook with it. The result is our new pride and joy, 'ffish 2.0'. We've left the ashes behind and embraced fire because who needs summer heat when you can have a crispy meal all year round!</p>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Light the fire and make it so hot that you can even hear the voices of hell itself in it (but, be careful with your eyebrows!).</li>
            <li>Throw the fish into the fire and watch as it absorbs all the wickedness and wails of the underworld. </li>
            <li>Once the fish has reached its peak level of wickedness, remove it from the fire (and don't forget to use heat-resistant gloves).</li>
        </ol>
